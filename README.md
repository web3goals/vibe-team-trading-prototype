## ➡️ Workflow

### 🏗️ Phase 1: Creating a Group

1. **Initiation**: User A opens the **Create Group** page.
2. **Agent Selection**: User A chooses an AI Agent based on their trading style:
   - 🔴 `alice-agent.eth` — **Aggressive**
   - 🔵 `bob-agent.eth` — **Conservative**
   - _Agent personalities are stored onchain via **ENS domains**. Their text records contain specific trading instructions and the owner's address, who receives a share of the trading fees generated by the agent's trading volume._
3. **Invitation**: User A invites User B and User C to join the groups.
4. **Session Start**: The app initializes a **Yellow App Session**.
   - _Agent: User A (0x...) created a group with alice-agent.eth (0x...), User B (0x...), and User C (0x...)_
   - _Agent: Yellow session created | Quorum: 2/3 users | User Alloc: 100.0 ytest.usd | Agent Alloc: 0.0 ytest.usd_

---

### 📈 Phase 2: Collaborative Trading

1. **Discussion**: Users post thoughts and sentiment in the group chat.
   - _User B: "Hey, should we buy BTC? The chart looks bullish."_
   - _User C: "Agreed, support is holding."_
2. **AI Analysis**: The Agent reads the chat, analyzes the market, and proposes a specific trade.
   - _Agent: "Buying BTC makes sense. I can allocate 1.0 USD from each member, selling when RSI < 30."_
3. **Consensus**: Users sign the new **trade proposal** by clicking the **Sign Idea** button.
   - _Agent: "User A signed the idea 👌 "_
   - _Agent: "User B signed the idea 👌"_
4. **State Update**: Once 2/3 quorum is reached, the Yellow app state updates with new allocations.

---

### ⚡ Phase 3: Execution & Settlement

1. **Withdrawal**: The Agent withdraws `ytest.usd` from Yellow to its execution wallet.
   - _Agent: "Withdrawn 3.0 USD to execute trade on LI.FI. Tx: 0x..."_
2. **Trade Execution**: The Agent executes the swap via **LI.FI**.
   - _Agent: "Bought X BTC for 3 USD. Tx: 0x..."_
3. **Profit Taking**: When conditions (e.g., RSI < 30) are met, the Agent sells.
   - _Agent: "RSI hit 30. Sold X BTC for 4 USD (Profit: 1 USD). Tx: 0x..."_
4. **Fee Processing**:
   - 🏦 **80%** of the trading volume fee to Agent Creator (from ENS record)
   - 🏗️ **20%** of the trading volume fee to the Vibe Team Trading Protocol
   - _Fees are processed automatically via LI.FI._
5. **Re-deposit**: The Agent deposits the final USD back into the Yellow unified balance.
   - _Agent: "Deposited 4 USD. Ready to distribute profit."_
6. **Final Signing**: Users sign the distribution message to update their final balances.
   - _User A: "Signing profit distribution..."_
   - _Agent: Quorum reached! New User Alloc: 101.3 USD | Agent Alloc: 0.0 USD_

---

### 💰 Phase 4: Closing

1. **Initiation**: A user initiates group closure by clicking the **Close Group** button.
   - _User A: "Let's close up and withdraw."_
2. **Consensus**: Other users sign the closing message to authorize final settlement.
   - _User B: "I've signed to close the group"_
   - _Agent: Quorum reached! Session closed. Final ledger balances settled._
